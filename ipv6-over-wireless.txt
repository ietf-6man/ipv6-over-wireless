     Architecture and Framework for IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Access
                 draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-over-wireless-05

Abstract

   This document presents an architecture for IPv6 access networks that
   decouples the network-layer concepts of Links, Interface, and Subnets
   from the link-layer concepts of links, ports, and broadcast domains,
   and limits the reliance on link-layer broadcasts.  This architecture
   is suitable for IPv6 over any network, including non-broadcast
   networks, which is typically the case for intangible media such as
   wireless and overlays.  A study of the issues with IPv6 ND over
   intangible media is presented, and a framework to solve those issues
   within the new architecture is proposed.

1.  Introduction

   IEEE Std. 802.1 [IEEE Std. 802.1] Ethernet Bridging provides an
   efficient and reliable broadcast service for wired networks;
   applications and protocols have been built that heavily depend on
   that feature for their core operation.  Unfortunately, Low-Power
   Lossy Networks (LLNs) and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)
   generally do not benefit from the same reliable and cheap broadcast
   capabilities as legacy Ethernet yellow wires, and protocols that rely
   on broadcasts are less suited in those environments.

   Similarly, the use of broadcast is discouraged in large Data Center
   (DC) fabrics and DC Interconnect (DCI) that extend the lower-layer
   links in large and physically distributed topologies, e.g., as meshes
   of point-to-point (P2P) tunnels.  In such case, an overlay broadcast
   service is typically emulated as ingress (or reflector) replication
   and generates massive amounts of underlay unicast messages, possibly
   over expensive Wide Area Network (WAN) links.

   All in all, as IPv6 [RFC8200] networks migrate from a physical wires
   to virtual or intangible media, the common requirement shows to
   decouple the abstractions that are manipulated at the network layer
   from physical properties such as broadcast capabilities and
   transitivity that are handled at the lower layers.

   The original IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC4861], [RFC4862]
   (IPv6 ND) relies heavily on broadcast operation for Router
   Advertisement (RA), address Resolution (AR), and Duplicate address
   Detection (DAD).  In modern networks, this may be inefficient (due to
   many replications over constrained links), unreliable (broadcast may
   be lost in transmission), counterproductive to network operations
   (broadcast storms), prone to impersonation and multiplication attacks
   (a unicast from the outside may cause a broadcast inside), and may be
   detrimental to privacy (an observer inside the network can discover
   other onlink addresses).

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   This document presents an architecture for IPv6 access networks that
   1) decouples the network-layer concepts of Links, Interface, and
   Subnets from the link-layer concepts of links, ports, and broadcast
   domains, and thereby 2) limits the reliance on (and impact thereof)
   link-layer broadcasts inside the Subnet.  This architecture is
   suitable for IPv6 over any network, including modern Non-Broadcast
   MultiAccess (NBMA) and non-transitive Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP)
   networks.  A study of the issues with IPv6 ND over wireless media is
   presented, and a framework to solve those issues within the new
   architecture is proposed.

3.  Issues with IPv6 ND-Based Access

3.1.  IPv6 ND and ND-Proxies

   Though IPv6 ND was the state of the art when designed for early
   Ethernet links at the end of the twentieth century, it is less
   appropriate for modern networks such as wireless and overlays that
   cannot provide the same cheap and reliable broadcast as a shared
   yellow wire.  The reactive AR operation was designed to limit the
   amount of memory that is needed for the ND cache, at times where
   memory was scarce in the adapters.  This trade-off, broadcast
   bandwidth vs. memory in the adapters, should be reevaluated for
   networks where router memory is aplenty but broadcast has become
   expensive.

   The IPv6 ND Neighbor Solicitation (NS) [RFC4861] message is used as a
   multicast IP packet for AR and DAD [RFC4862].  While the AR message
   is intended for one node that owns the Target address, the
   expectation for DAD is that there's no node at all with that address.
   A message that is intended for at most one node is certainly a poor
   match for a broadcast operation.

   The NS messages used in AR and DAD exchanges are sent at the network
   layer to a Solicited-Node multicast address (SNMA) [RFC4291] and
   should in theory only reach a very small group of nodes.  But to
   support SNMA, the host must also support multicast Listener Discovery
   (MLD) [RFC3810], which may be an additional burden to a constrained
   stack, and the switches should support their own multicast routing
   and state, which is pushing the real problems to the lower layers.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   Also, if implemented, the SNMA proceure would entail close to one
   state per address is every switch since there is often only one
   address with the same SNMA in the network - though the birthday
   paradox applies.  This amount of memory may not have been available
   in early switches, and still makes little economical sense today when
   a complete ND cache requires one state per address in every router
   only, as opposed to one in every switch, when the Subnet prefix is
   advertised as not-onlink.

   This is why, in practice, IPv6 ND messages to a SNMA are mapped to
   link-layer broadcast on Ethernet and Wireless networks, and to full
   ingress replication in overlays.  multicast NS transmissions may
   occur when a node joins the network, moves, or wakes up and
   reconnects to the network.  Over a very large fabric, this can
   generate hundreds of broadcasts per second.

   If the broadcasts were blindly copied over Wi-Fi links, the link-
   layer broadcast traffic associated to ND network-layer multicast
   could consume enough bandwidth to cause a substantial degradation to
   the unicast service [MCAST EFFICIENCY].  This is why ND Proxies are
   deployed and charged to reduce the resulting flood; sadly, ND-Proxies
   are not fully reliable for the lack of a deterministic state on all
   existing addresses, which leads to unpredictable failures in IPv6 ND
   operations.

   The IPv6 ND Neighbor Advertisement (NA) [RFC4861] message can also be
   sent as a multicast to all nodes, as a gratuitous information that
   can be used to override the address mapping in nodes with an existing
   Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) for the Target address.  If this is done,
   all nodes in the broadcast domain are impected though there's
   probably none or very few with an NCE.  When it is not done, nodes
   with an NCE will be unable to reach the Target IP address until
   Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) discovers the issue.  Both
   alternatives are unsatisfactory, meaning that the whole approach
   should be revisited.

   This problem can be alleviated by reducing the size of the broadcast
   domain that encompasses wireless access links.  This has been done in
   the art of IP subnetting by partitioning the subnets and by routing
   between them, at the extreme by assigning a prefix, say a /64, to
   each wireless node (see [RFC8273]).

   Another way to split the broadcast domain within a Subnet is to proxy
   the network-layer protocols that rely on link-layer broadcast
   operations at the boundary of the split broadcast domains.  As an
   example, [IEEE Std. 802.11] recommends deploying an "ARP proxy" for
   the IPv4 address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and IPv6 ND at the APs.
   The correct operation of the proxy requires the exhaustive list of

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   the IP addresses for which proxying is provided.  Forming and
   maintaining that knowledge is a hard problem in the general case of
   radio connectivity, which keeps changing with movements and
   variations in the environment that alter the range of transmissions.
   It is achieved in Wi-Fi networks through the proactive method of the
   wireless association, which is akin to the registration procedure in
   this architecture.

   [SAVI] suggests discovering the addresses by snooping the IPv6 ND
   protocol, but that can also be unreliable.  An IPv6 address may not
   be discovered immediately due to a packet loss.  It may never be
   discovered in the case of a "silent" node that is not currently using
   one of its addresses, e.g., a printer that waits in wake-on-lan
   state.  A change of anchor, e.g. due to a movement, may be missed or
   misordered, leading to unreliable connectivity and an incomplete list
   of addresses.  Bottom line: snooping IPv6 ND is not appropriate to
   form and maintain a deterministic knowledge of the IPv6 addresses of
   all the neighbors that are reachable over a network port.

3.2.  The case of Wireless

   Like Transparent Bridging, the IPv6 ND operation is reactive, and
   relies on IP multicast for the AR and DAD procedures.  As discussed
   in Section 3, the network-layer multicast operation is typically
   implemented as a link-layer broadcast for the lack of an adapted and
   scalable link-layer multicast operation on most WLANs and Low-Power
   Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs).  It results that on wireless, IPv6
   ND multicast messages are typically broadcasted.

   As opposed to unicast transmissions, the broadcast transmissions over
   wireless links are not subject to automatic retries (ARQ) and
   therefore are not reliable.  Reducing the speed at the physical (PHY)
   layer for broadcast transmissions can increase the reliability, at
   the expense of a higher relative cost of broadcast on the overall
   available bandwidth.

   Excessive use of broadcast by protocols such as IPv6 ND and Bonjour/
   mDNS (see [RFC6762]) led network administrators to install multicast
   rate limiting to protect the network.  Experimentally, this proved to
   have a dramatic effect on ND performance in large wireless networks.
   From some testing done at an IETF meeting a few years ago, it seemed
   that up to 90% of IPv6 link-local multicasts were dropped.  The
   impact on user experience is usually limited since for the most part,
   the users will connect to addresses outside the Subnet and will not
   attempt to locate one another.  The impact on the NOC might still be
   significant, since a failure related to ND operations might be
   transient and difficult to debunk after the fact.

   Another experiment conducted during an IETF meeting consisted in
   manually forcing address duplicates to observe the DAD behavior.
   This experiment showed that DAD often (up to 80% of times was
   observed) fails to discover the duplication of IPv6 addresses, at
   least in a large wireless access networks, see [DAD ISSUES] for more.
   In practice, IPv6 addresses very rarely conflict, not because the
   address duplications are detected and resolved by the DAD operation,
   but thanks to the entropy of the typically 64-bit Interface IDs
   (IIDs) that makes a collision quasi-impossible for randomized IIDs.
   This is why, even when DAD fails, the user experience is rarely
   affected.

   Excessive use of broadcast also places a toll on the battery of
   wireless devices such as IoT sensors and smartphones.  On paper, a
   Wi-Fi station must keep its radio turned on to listen to the periodic
   series of broadcast frames.  Most of those broadcasts are dropped at
   the network layer when the receiving node finds it is not interested,
   as is the case of NS messages when the node is not the Target.  In
   order to protect the battery lifetime, a typical smartphone will
   listen at a multiple of the broadcast period, blindly ignoring a
   large ratio of the broadcasts, and making IPv6 ND operations even
   less reliable.

   Net-net: broadcast transmissions are not reliable on wireless.
   Protocols designed for bridged networks that rely on broadcast
   transmissions often exhibit disappointing behaviors when employed
   unmodified on a local wireless medium (more in [RFC9119] ).  Even
   though there is at most one intended Target for a broadcast AR or DAD
   message, the broadcast impacts many wireless nodes over the whole
   Subnet (e.g., the ESS fabric), and yet the chances that intended
   Target receives the packet are limited.  The fact that the user
   experience for IPv6 ND is not so dramatically affected only shows
   that those broadcasts are, for a large part, a useless waste of
   expensive resources.

   Wi-Fi Access Points [IEEE Std. 802.11] (APs) deployed in an Extended
   Service Set (ESS) act as [IEEE Std. 802.1] bridges between the
   wireless stations (STA) and the wired backbone.  As opposed to the
   classical Transparent (aka Learning) Bridge operation that installs
   the forwarding state reactively to traffic, the bridging state in the
   AP is established proactively, at the time of association.  The
   association process registers the link-layer (MAC) address of the STA
   to the AP proactively, i.e., before it is needed.  Based on that
   information, the AP maintains the exhaustive list of the associated
   MAC addresses and blocks the link-layer lookups for destination MAC
   addresses that are not associated to this AP.  While the association
   procedure protects the wireless medium against broadcast-intensive
   Transparent Bridging lookups, the same problem remains at the network
   layer for the lack of a similar procedure in IPv6 ND.

3.3.  The case of Overlays

   Link-layer Overlays (e.g., VLANs) reduce the broadcast domain from
   the physical one, whereas network-layer overlays (e.g., VxLAN) can
   extend the Subnet beyond the limits of the physical network, enabling
   to deploy a Subnet over a large physical domain.  The success of
   network-layer overlays in Cloud DC deployments illustrate the need to
   decouple the Subnet from the limits of the physical network.

   A network-layer overlay is typically a partial or full mesh of point
   to point tunnels between routers.  In case of a full mesh, BUM
   (Broadcast, Unknown, and multicast) forwarding across the overlay can
   be implemented as a replication at the ingress router or at a
   dedicated reflector, but either way entails a growing congestion and
   latency as the overlay grows in size.  BUM forwarding has become so
   detrimental to the network operations that some operators decide to
   turn it off.  This means that a silent node, whose location is
   unknown to the fabric control plane and possibly forgotten, cannot be
   rediscovered by AR procedures, and will not be reachable again until
   it volunteers its own sign of life.  To avoid this, modern protocols
   should be designed such that the use of overlay-wide broadcasts are
   limited to operations where a real distribution operation is desired,
   e.g., every node is interested in receiving the packet.

   While a multicast IPv6 ND RA message may be of interest within a site
   or a subsite to all local nodes, it is probably of little interest to
   other sites that are served by other routers, even when the overlay
   spans across both sites.  The same goes for a local printer, the
   broadcast mDNS [RFC6762] lookup should reach local printers but not
   necessarily faraway ones.  This is another indication of the need to
   decouple the span of the Subnet from the lower layer broadcast
   domain, and dedicate the broadcast service to local operations such
   as discovery of really local resources, regardless of the actual span
   of the Subnet.

   As discussed in Section 3.2, multicast IPv6 ND messages are in fact
   broadcasted across the overlay, meaning that they contribute to the
   BUM traffic and are treated as full broadcast.  Yet, those messages
   are used for AR and DAD and intend to reach at most one node, the
   owner of the Target address, if any.  Using a BUM transmission that
   reaches every nodes in the overlay to communicate with at most one is
   a misuse of the overlay resources and should be replaced by unicast-
   based methods.

   In data centers, overlays are typically combined with server
   multihoming at the edge.  An advanced Network Interface Card (NIC) is
   equipped with more than one Ethernet ports for redundancy, which
   connect to different leaf switches (aka ToR) to the same cloud
   network.  The server (say, using Kubernetes) needs a single address
   and would rather use that address on both ports to the same Subnet,
   and use either network port for its own reasons, e.g., load
   balancing, independently of IP addressing considerations.  This means
   that the IP Interface abstraction that the server needs is a logical
   construct, decoupled from the network ports, and capable to encompass
   more than one.

3.4.  Power and Sustainability

   In the wireless case, broadcasts are sent at the slowest speed
   available, which can be a hundred time slower than unicast
   transmissions, in order to maximize the chances that all nodes in the
   BSS will receive the frame.  For that relatively long duration, the
   broadcast transmission holds the spectrum locally, which adds to the
   latency of pending unicast frames and generates interferences
   remotely, which may cascade in losses, exponential backoff delays,
   and retries in adjacent networks.  In the process, the broadcast
   transmission consumes up to a hundred time more power than unicast
   transmission of equivalent payload size.  Power is also wasted when
   replicating a multicast packet to span an overlay, each time the
   packet is ultimately dropped by the recipient.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   Constrained IoT devices conserve power by placing themselves in deep
   sleep for most of their time.  While a device is sleeping, it cannot
   answer IPv6 ND messages for AR and DAD.  This makes IPv6 ND
   unsuitable to IoT devices.  The 6LoWPAN WG has determined that the
   most appropriate model for a constrained network is a pull model
   where the device wakes up, negotiates with its router(s) for
   addresses and connectivity for some amount of time in the future, and
   goes back to sleep.  The router can then perform a role of sleep
   proxy that defends the address(es) and holds traffic for the device
   till the device wakes up and pulls it from the router.  Additionally,
   broadcast operations become rapidly inacceptable in terms of power
   and bandwidth when the constrained network grows into a mesh.  In an
   LLN, hosts generally do not perform AR for one another, and the not-
   onlink prefix model is mandatory.

   In all cases, to make the Internet greener, we must reconsider the
   use of broadcast over large access networks.  To maintain the
   capability to build the Subnets we want, the IPv6 architecture must
   enable to decouple the Subnet from the broadcast domain, make the
   broadcast domain small and local, and refocus the use of broadcast to
   the cases where all nodes are interested.  Additionally, the IPv6
   architecture must enable a model where the network serves and
   protects low-power devices that sleep most of the time and wake up on
   their own schedule.

3.5.  Security and Privacy

   Broadcasting IPv6 ND messages exposes the source and the Target
   addresses to the whole network, including nodes that do not need to
   know that those addresses are present in the network.  A passive
   listener may discover the addresses without any observable action or
   possibility of control by the source.  Once it has discovered the
   presence of neighbor addresses, the onlink attacker can impersonate
   any host in the network, either by sourcing packets with a stolen
   address, or by overriding the neighbor caches with a NA that
   indicates the attacker's link-layer address.

   It is thus desirable to avoid exposing the host IPv6 address in
   broadcast ND messages.  A more private approach has each node see and
   connect to only a subset of the routers using the not-onlink model.
   The source may still shortcut to the destination when the destination
   is effectively on link, based on redirect messages from the router,
   when desirable.  Additionally, it is desirable that only the address
   owner can source packets with that address, and that another party
   may neither be able to claim traffic for nor source packets from that
   address.

   The reactive NS lookup method can also be abused from the outside of
   the network to perform DOS attacks on constrained resources in the
   network.  The attacker just needs to forge random addresses from the
   Subnet prefix and send one packet to each of these random address.
   The Subnet ingress router will have to store each of those packets
   for the duration of the lookup time, and broadcast an NS to lookup
   each of the forged address.  This both locks memory in the router and
   consumes bandwidth and energy inside the Subnet.  All nodes in the
   Subnet are also impacted, at the minimum to check that they do not
   own the Target address.

   To avoid the lookup delays and associated attacks, it makes sense to
   use a proactive method whereby the router knows all the addresses
   present in the network and their link-layer address mapping in
   advance.  When this is achieved, if the destination address of an
   incoming packet is not present in the router tables, then it can be
   safely assumed that the destination does not exist in the network and
   the packet may be dropped by the forwarding engine, e.g., in
   hardware.

3.6.  More Middleboxes

   The above problems have been observed at least since the early 2000s,
   and a number of remediation actions were attempted.  For instance,
   IEEE std 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11] mandates the support of a
   middlebox operation called "ARP proxy" for IPv4 and IPv6 in the
   Access Point (AP).  The "ARP Proxy" cancels broadcasts over a BSS
   when the IP Target of the ARP/ND message is not owned by a STA
   associated to the AP.  With IPv4, the expectation is that the non-AP
   station (STA) owns exactly one IP address, and that the address is
   obtained via DHCP right after the association, so it is simple and
   deterministic to snoop the address in the DHCP exchange (as long as
   it remains in the clear), and with that deterministic knowledge of
   all IPv4 addresses in the BSS, cancel ARP lookups that do not match.

   In contrast to IPv4, IPv6 enables a node to form multiple addresses
   per Link, some of them temporary and with a particular attention paid
   to privacy.  Addresses may be formed and deprecated asynchronously to
   the association.  Even if the knowledge of IPv6 addresses used by a
   STA can be obtained by snooping protocols such as IPv6 ND and DHCPv6,
   or by observing data traffic sourced at the STA, such methods provide
   only an imperfect knowledge of the state of the STA at the AP.  This
   may result in a loss of connectivity for some IPv6 addresses, in
   particular for addresses rarely used and in a situation of mobility.
   This may also result in undesirable state persistence in the AP when
   a STA ceases to use an IPv6 address.  It follows that snooping
   protocols is not a recommended technique and that it should only be
   used as last resort.

   Because IPv6 ND is so easy to attack, some vendors have deployed
   undocumented proprietary counter measures as middlebox operation in
   the switches and routers.  Those middleboxes snoop the IPv6 ND
   messages, filter them or modify them, for instance to change their
   link-layer scope from broadcast to unicast.  Based on the snooped
   information, the middlebox may for instance drop an RA message that
   appears to be coming from a host (e.g., as inferred because it is
   received on a wireless adapter), or an NA message coming from a
   device that does not appear to be the owner.  But, for the lack of an
   explicit contract between the host and the middlebox, the middlebox
   cannot determine who the real owner is, and it may deny a rightful
   user.

   In a managed network, IP addresses are an expensive and thus a
   limited resource.  To ensure a fair use and protect against DOS
   attacks, the middlebox may also block Stateless address
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) from a host above a fixed number of
   addresses.  When that happens, the host believes that it can use the
   address but fails to connect with it.  This might happen even if the
   host has ceased to use other addresses and is now within the allowed
   quota.  IPv6 ND lacks both a method for the host to know how many
   addresses it can own, and a method for the router to know which
   addresses the host uses at any point of time.  The infrastructure
   needs a deterministic knowledge of the addresses in use, and for that
   a contract must be passed between the host and the network to ensure
   that all the addresses are known and usable.

   Maybe the most insidious side effect of those middleboxes is that as
   opposed to NAT, their operation is obfuscated and proprietary.  From
   one vendor to the next, and from one product generation to the next,
   their behavior may evolve and affect IPv6 ND in different fashions.
   In the short term, this may only impact some specific deployments,
   which may have to work around the issues.  In the longer term, this
   may affect the capability we have to evolve the protocol, like
   firewalls impact our capability to develop new transports in parallel
   to TCP and UDP.  We must either standardize (e.g., for ND proxy) or
   eliminate those middlebox activities, and for that, the IPv6 ND
   protocol must evolve to a model where proprietary middleboxes are not
   needed anymore.  This demands a model that minimizes the use of
   broadcasts, and where a contract provides mutual guarantees for the
   host that need IPv6 addresses and the routers that provide
   reachability and protection for these addresses.

3.7.  More Operational Issues

   "Selectively Isolating Hosts to Prevent Potential Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol Issues" [ND CONSIDERATIONS] reviews a number of IPv6 ND
   issues and their possible mitigation in various scenarios.  The
   considered issues include:

   1.  Impact of multicast on performance and reliability

   2.  Security exposures from the implicit trust of all on-link nodes

   3.  On-Demand Neighbor Cache management as a source of performance
       issues, including exhaustion problems

   4.  Consequences of the lack of subscriber management capabilities

   Table 1 "Which solution solves which issue(s)" of [ND CONSIDERATIONS]
   indicates that the evaluated issues can be alleviated with the
   framework detailed in Section 5.

3.8.  Summary of Issues

   IPv6 ND inherited 2 majors design points from IPv4, a strong coupling
   of logical and physical concepts, which creates unacceptable
   constraints on modern deployments with virtual and intangible links,
   and a reactive operation for AR and DAD that requires an extensive
   use of broadcast spanning the Subnet.  While IPv4 and IPv6 behaviors
   are similar for addresses obtained via DHCP, the cost of AR and DAD
   makes IPv6 significantly more expensive than IPv4 when SLAAC is
   enabled.

   And while IPv4 supported NBMA and P2MP models (e.g., on Frame Relay
   leveraging OSPFv2), the IPv6 promise to support NBMA (for ATM)
   remains unmet to this day, as only P2P and Transit links are properly
   supported by IPv6 ND.  For those reasons, as well as inherent
   complexity and unpredictability, IPv6 with SLAAC can be significantly
   less attractive than IPv4 to some network administrators.

   IPv6 ND exposes all addresses to all nodes in the network, which is
   unfit for privacy.  It is prone to DOS attacks from outside the
   network and impersonation attacks from the inside, with no method to
   prove the address ownership and perform Source address Validation
   (SAVI) later on the data traffic.  To protect against such threats,
   the vendors had to introduce middleboxes that interfere with the
   protocol operation and affect the capability to evolve the protocol
   in the future.

   IPv6 ND lacks a support for mobility (which typically entails a
   sequence counter maintained by the host and the deprecation of state
   that is based on older sequences) and for anycast.  This makes it
   very hard for the network to defend the addresses on behalf of the
   owner, e.g., when the owner is temporarily disconnected.  It results
   that the operation of the middleboxes is unsatisfactory and may cause
   discontinuities in connectivity.

   The extensive use of broadcast operations in IPv6 ND is not only
   detrimental to bandwidth, it is also an issue for energy conservation
   and sustainability.  Devices must be always attached and always
   powered on to answer NS messages, which makes IPv6 ND inapplicable to
   power-conserving devices such as IoT sensors that sleep for the vast
   majority of their time.

4.  IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Networks Architecture

4.1.  Basic Concepts

   This document introduces an alternate architecture for IPv6 access
   networks that is designed to apply to the WLANs and LoWPANs types of
   networks as well as other NBMA networks such as Data-Center overlays
   and P2MP networks such as IoT radio meshes.  It may be used as a
   replacement to the IPv6 ND reactive model in any network where the
   issues discussed in Section 3 are detrimental to the network
   operation.

   The key design points in this architecture derive from the original
   observations made at the 6LoWPAN WG for constrained devices and
   networks, and focus on avoiding waste of limited resources such as
   spectrum and energy, by using broadcasts only when broadcast is
   really needed, and decoupling the IP abstraction of a Subnet from the
   broadcast domains to avoid Subnet-wide broadcast storms.  To that
   effect, this architecture leverages the not-onlink model and routing
   inside the Subnet, which enables to form potentially large MLSNs
   without creating a large broadcast domain at the link layer.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   To support the deployment agility that virtual (e.g., VxLAN overlays
   and pseudowires) and intangible (e.g., wireless, laser, and quantum)
   links enable, the IP abstractions of Interface, Link, and Subnet are
   decoupled from their classical physical counterparts of port, link,
   and broadcast domains.  The Subnet is defined by a prefix length
   called Subnet Prefix Length (SPL), as the longest aggregation that
   can be advertised in the IGP.  An SPL of 64 is typical though the
   architecture does not mandate it.  Host routes and prefixes longer
   than SPL are advertised inside the Subnet only, using a separate
   Subnet Gateway protocol (SGP).  The SGP is only required in the case
   of P2MP networks where routers need to relay packets inside the
   subnet.

   Any device that owns an address within the Subnet prefix belongs to
   the Subnet, this is now decoupled from the physical connectivity and
   broadcast domain.  Instead, the IPv6 routers that serve a Subnet must
   form a connected dominating set such that every host in the Subnet is
   connected to at least one router and the routers are connected to one
   another directly (classical NBMA, aka full mesh) or indirectly via
   other routers (Point to MultiPoint, P2MP, aka partial mesh).  The
   not-onlink model is used throughout, so hosts do not look each other
   up, saving all the associated broadcast.  Instead, they rely on the
   routers to forward the packets inside and outside the Subnet.  This
   way, the Subnet can have any structure needed for the deployment,
   where hosts can move from router to router in the Subnet, or anywhere
   in the Internet provided they can lay a mobility tunnel to one of the
   routers for use as IP Link to the Subnet.

   All IP Links are abstracted as Point-to-Point, though a lower-layer
   broadcast service may be used by the router to send RAs to a subset
   of local hosts in the Subnet, or by the host to send an RS message to
   a subset of the routers.  An IP Interface bundles one or more
   subInterfaces, one per Subnet that can be reached through that
   Interface.  A Global IPv6 address is installed on the subInterface
   that connects to the Subnet from which the address derives.  The IP
   Interface connects to one or more IP Links (to different neighbors)
   over the same or over different physical ports (they are decoupled).
   A link-local address is associated to the IP Link directly.  Each
   SubInterface connects to the subset of those IP Links that reach
   other nodes in the Subnet.

   In a fashion similar to a IEEE std 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11]
   Association, IPv6 nodes register their addresses to one or more
   neighbor router(s), which may reject the registration, e.g., in case
   of a duplication.  With the registration, the routers collectively
   build a complete knowledge of the hosts they serve and in return,
   hosts obtain guaranteed routing services for their registered
   addresses for a contractual lifetime.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   To support distributed routers in the Subnet, an abstract registrar
   service maintains the state of all active registrations in the Subnet
   and answers queries to lookup mappings, validate ownership, and avoid
   duplications.  The registration is abstract to the routing service
   and the registrar service, and it can be protected to prevent
   impersonation attacks.  The registration enables the network to know
   deterministically all the IPv6 addresses and link-layer address
   mapping currently in use, and eliminates the need for lookups and
   DAD, and for the associated broadcasts.

   The abstract routing service allows an ingress router to find a path
   to the destination address within the Subnet.  It can be a simple
   reflection in a Hub-and-Spoke Subnet that emulates an IEEE Std.
   802.11 Infrastructure BSS at the network layer.  It can also be a
   full-fledge routing protocol, e.g., RPL (see [RFC9010]), which is
   designed to adapt to various LLNs such as WLAN and WPAN radio meshes,
   or RIFT (see [I-D.ietf-rift-rift]) or BGP/EVPN (see [RFC8365]), for
   application in data centers.  It can be based on overlay tunnels
   between ingress router and egress router leveraging a resolver
   service such as LISP, see [RFC7834] for more.  Finally, the routing
   service can also be an ND proxy that emulates an IEEE Std. 802.11
   Infrastructure ESS at the network layer, as specified in the IPv6
   Backbone Router [RFC8929].

   The abstract registrar service maintains the mapping between the
   registered node link-layer address and the registered IPv6 address.
   It contains meta data that enables to ascertain that the second
   registration for the same address is performed for the same
   registered node, so it also binds the registered node with the
   registered IPv6 address.  The registrar service provides APIs to look
   up a link-layer address for an IPv6 address as well as validate IPv6
   address ownership.  The registrar can be implemented as a mapping
   server ala LISP [RFC6830], a distributed state ala ND proxy
   [RFC8929], or a synchronized state ala EVPN [RFC7432].  In the former
   case, this enables the reactive lookups to be performed as unicast
   requests to the map resolver.  In the latter, the address mapping is
   synchronized by the routing protocol and known to all the routers for
   all nodes in the IP Subnet, so there is never a need for a reactive
   lookup.

   On the one hand, the Architecture proposed in this document avoids
   the use of broadcast operation for DAD and AR, and on the other hand,
   it supports use cases where Subnet and link-layer domains are not
   congruent, which is common in wireless networks unless a specific
   link-layer emulation is provided.

   The address registration establishes a contract between the nodes and
   the routers where nodes can ask for addresses which will be
   guaranteed to be operational for a contractual lifetime, and the
   network may accept or refuse granting additional addresses based on
   state (e.g., duplicate address) as well as policy (e.g., quota).
   This ways hosts and routers agree deterministically on which
   addresses will be served to which nodes in the Subnet.  The
   registration is agnostic to the router to router and router to
   registrar interfaces.  The latter interface can be implemented in
   various fashions that can blend in existing technologies such as
   legacy IPv6 ND network through ND proxy, as well as EVPN-based and
   LISP-based overlays.

4.2.  Terminology

4.2.1.  IP Links

   The term "link" refers to layer 2 (comprising MAC and link layers)
   communication medium that can be leveraged at layer 3 (aka IP layer,
   aka network layer) to instantiate one IP hop (see section 2 of
   [RFC8200].  In this document we conserve that term (lowercase) but
   differentiate it from an IP Link, which is a network-layer
   abstraction that somehow represents the link but is not the link,
   like the map is not the country.

   With IPv6, IP has moved to network-layer abstractions for its
   operations, e.g., with the use of a link-local address (LLA), and
   that of IP multicast for link-scoped operations.  At the same time,
   the concept of an IP Link emerged as an abstraction that represents
   how the network layer considers the link:

   *  An IP Link connects an IP node to one or more other IP nodes using
      a lower-layer subnetwork.  The lower-layer subnetwork may comprise
      multiple links, e.g., in the case of a switched fabric or a mesh-
      under LLN.

   *  an IP Link defines the scope of an LLA, and defines the domain in
      which the LLA must be unique

   *  An IP Link is attached to a physical port, and one link-local
      address is associated to the IP Link.

   *  an IP Link provides a subset of the connectivity that is offered
      by the physical link at the lower layer; if the IP Link is
      narrower than the link-layer reachable domain, then network-layer
      filters must restrict the link-scoped communication to remain
      between peers on a same IP Link.  More than one IP Link may be
      installed on the same network port to connect to different peers.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   *  an IP Link can be Point to Point (P2P), Point to Point (P2MP,
      forming a partial mesh and non-transitive), NBMA (non-broadcast
      multi-access, fully meshed), or transit (broadcast-capable and
      any-to-any).

   It is a network design decision to use one IP Link model or another
   over a given lower-layer subnetwork, e.g., to map a Frame Relay
   network as a P2MP IP Link, or as a collection of P2P IP Links.  As
   another example, an Ethernet fabric may be bridged, in which case the
   nodes that interconnect the lower-layer links are L2 switches, and
   the fabric can be abstracted as a single transit IP Link; or the
   fabric can be routed, in which case the P2P IP Links are congruent
   with the link-layer links, and the nodes that interconnect the links
   are routers.

   This architecture only uses P2P Link abstractions as shown in
   Figure 1, where an IP Link is identified by a pair of local and
   remote link-layer (MAC) address.  A network port may enable to reach
   to more than one peer at the link layer; in that case, this
   architecture maps each peer relationship as a different IP Link.  A
   link-local address only needs to be unique within that peer to peer
   relationship.

   If only the network port but not the link-layer address of the peer
   is visible from the network layer when processing a message, then the
   network layer cannot discriminate the IP Link of packets arriving on
   the same network port, and for that reason, it will reject a second

   registration for the same link-local address by a second peer,
   meaning that a link-local address will have to be unique on a network
   port across IP Links.  In that case, the link-local address of the
   peer is used to identify the IP Link, and all the addresses
   registered to this node with the same peer link-local address as
   source will be associated to the same IP Link to that peer.

4.2.2.  IP Interfaces

   As is the case for links, the term interface has been historically
   confused between the network port that provides physical
   connectivity, and the network-layer abstraction that connects the
   host with the IP Link:

   *  an IP Interface is an abstraction that connects the host with a
      collection of IP Links (for the purpose of link-local
      communication) and bundles the interfaces for each IP Subnet as
      subInterfaces.  The host installs at least one link-local address
      on an IP Interface for each IP Link that is connected through that
      Interface, and one subInterface per Subnet.  The same link-local
      address may be reused over different IP Links as long as it is not
      a collision for the peer on that IP Link.  Similarly, the host
      installs one or more global scope unicast address(es) on an IP
      subInterface for the associated Subnet, and the address is
      advertised over each IP Link in the SubInterface.

   *  an IP Interface can be P2P, in which case it connects to a single
      IP Link, or P2MP, in which case it aggregates multiple IP Links.
      In a multihomed host, a single IP Interface can be installed to
      connect to the IP Links associated to different network ports, in
      which case the same IPv6 address may be advertised on more than
      one network port.  Conversely, when more than one Subnet is
      reachable over a network port, more than one IP Interface may
      leverage that network port for transmission.

   IPv6 builds another abstraction, the IP Subnet, over one shared IP
   Link or over a collection IP Links, forming a MLSN in the latter
   case.  An MLSN is formed over IP Links (e.g., P2P or P2MP) that are
   interconnected by routers that either inject hosts routes in an SGP,
   in which case the topology can be anything, or perform ND proxy
   operations, in which case the structure of links must be strictly
   hierarchical to avoid loops.

         IP Subnet

                        Figure 3: Subnet Abstraction

   It is a network design decision to use one IP Subnet model or another
   over a given lower-layer network.  A switched fabric can host one or
   more IP subnets, in which case the IP Links can reach all and beyond
   one Subnet.  On the other hand, a Subnet can encompass a collection
   of links; in that case, the scope of the link-local addresses, which
   is the IP Link, is narrower than the span of the Subnet.

   A Subnet prefix is associated with the IP Subnet, and a node is a
   member of an IP Subnet when it has an IP address that derives from
   that prefix.  The IP address has Global Unicast scope (in the formal
   sense of [RFC4291]), and, as opposed to link-local Addresses, the
   scope of the address is not limited to the IP Link.

   The switched and routed fabric above could be the exact same network
   of physical links and boxes, what changes is the way the networking
   abstractions are mapped onto the system, and the implication of such
   decision include the capability to reach another node at the link
   layer, and the size of the broadcast domain and related broadcast
   storms.

4.2.4.  ND Proxies

   [RFC8929] defines bridging and routing IPv6 ND proxies for
   registering nodes / registered addresses.  Both forms of ND proxies
   interconnect IP Links and enable to isolate the link-layer broadcast
   domains.  But in the case of a bridging proxy, the link-layer unicast
   communication can still exist between the link-layer domains that are
   covered by network-layer links, whereas in the base of a routing
   proxy, they are isolated, and packets must be routed back and forth.
   Bridging proxies are possible between compatible technologies and
   translational bridges (e.g., Wi-Fi to Ethernet), whereas routing
   proxies are required between non-bridgeable technologies and
   desirable to avoid exposing the link-layer addresses across, e.g.,
   for reasons of stability and scalability.

   ND proxies can also serve IPv6 nodes that still rely on IPv6 ND in a
   coexistence scenario.  The ND proxy intercepts (snoops) the multicast
   NS messages from the nodes and, in case or AR or DAD, polls the
   registrar to lookup whether an active mapping exists for the Target.
   When that is the case, the ND proxy may forward the NS message as a
   link-layer unicast to the node that owns the binding, else it may
   either drop the multicast or broadcast it at the link layer.  Once
   the node formed an address, the ND proxy fills the registrar to
   associate the IPv6 address with the node.  The method is brittle,
   since there is no contract with the node to guarantee the ownership,
   no "contract", as discussed in Section 3.6, so for those addresses,
   the registrar may be inaccurate.

4.2.5.  Subnet Gateway Protocols

   The SPL boundary creates a wall between the traditional Interior
   Gateway Protocols (IGP) that operate between Subnets and manipulate
   shorter than SPL prefixes, and Subnet Gateway Protocols (SGP) that
   operate inside a Subnet and manipulate longer than SPL prefixes,
   typically /128 host routes, and possibly more specific data like
   link-layer address mappings and address Proof of Ownership.

   As opposed to classical IGPs, an SGP must support rapid mobility of
   addresses to cope with wireless devices and virtual machines
   mobility.  In that regard, an SGP operates mores as a MANET protocol
   than as a classical IGP.  Ideally, there should be no stale route,
   and no microloop.  A classical method in MANETs to achieve this is to
   sequence the movements and advertise the sequence in the routing
   protocol, so only routes with the most recent sequence can be
   followed, and once a packet starts following a route with a certain
   sequence, it must be discarded rather to have to follow a path with
   an older sequence.  To support this approach, the node that registers
   an address must be the owner of a mobility sequence number and update
   that sequence when it moves.

   Multihoming being a classical requirement in DC environments, the SGP
   must be able to differentiate not only address duplication from
   movement, but also from anycast addresses, which can be advertised
   from multiple places in a coordinated (same mobility sequence) or
   uncoordinated fashion.  For unicast addresses, an token that
   identifies the address owner can be used for address duplication
   avoidance, and if that token is cryptographic, it can be used as
   registration ownership verifier as well.

4.3.  IP Models

4.3.1.  Physical Broadcast Domain

   At the physical (PHY) layer, a node's broadcast domain is the set of
   nodes that may receive a transmission that the node sends over a
   network port, for instance the set of nodes in range of the radio
   transmission.  This set can comprise a single peer on a serial cable
   used as point-to-point link.  It may also comprise multiple peer
   nodes on a broadcast radio or a shared physical resource such as the
   Ethernet wires and hubs for which IPv6 ND was initially designed.

   On WLAN and LoWPAN radios, the physical broadcast domain is defined
   relative to a particular transmitter, as the set of nodes that can
   receive what this transmitter is sending.  Literally every frame
   defines its own broadcast domain since the chances of reception of a
   given frame are statistical.  In average and in stable conditions,
   the broadcast domain of a particular node can be still be seen as
   mostly constant and can be used to define a closure of nodes on which
   an upper-layer abstraction can be built.

   A physical-layer communication can be established between two nodes
   if the physical broadcast domains of their unicast transmissions
   include one another.  On WLAN and LoWPAN radios, that relation is
   usually not reflexive, since nodes disable the reception when they
   transmit; still they may retain a copy of the transmitted frame, so



Thubert & Richardson      Expires 21 March 2024                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   it can be seen as reflexive at the MAC layer.  It is often symmetric,
   meaning that if B can receive a frame from A, then A can receive a
   frame from B.  But there can be asymmetries due to power levels,
   interferers near one of the receivers, or differences in the quality
   of the hardware (e.g., crystals, PAs and antennas) that may affect
   the balance to the point that the connectivity becomes mostly uni-
   directional, e.g., A to B but practically not B to A.

   It takes a particular effort to place a set of devices in a fashion
   that all their physical broadcast domains fully overlap, and that
   specific situation can not be assumed in the general case.  In other
   words, the relation of radio connectivity is generally not
   transitive, meaning that A in range of B and B in range of C does not
   necessarily imply that A is in range of C.

4.3.2.  Link-layer Broadcast Emulations

   We call Direct MAC Broadcast (DMB) the transmission mode where the
   broadcast domain that is usable at the MAC layer is directly the
   physical broadcast domain.  IEEE Std. 802.15.4 [IEEE Std. 802.15.4]
   and IEEE Std. 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11] OCB (for Out of the Context
   of a BSS) are examples of DMB radios.  DMB networks provide mostly
   symmetric and non-transitive transmission.  This contrasts with a
   number of link-layer Broadcast Emulation (LLBE) schemes that are
   described in this section.

   In the case of Ethernet, while a physical broadcast domain is
   constrained to a single shared wire, the IEEE Std. 802.1 [IEEE Std.
   802.1] bridging function emulates the broadcast properties of that
   wire over a whole physical mesh of Ethernet links.  For the upper
   layer, the qualities of the shared wire are essentially conserved,
   with a reliable and cheap broadcast operation over a transitive
   closure of nodes defined by their connectivity to the emulated wire.

   In large switched fabrics, overlay techniques enable a limited
   connectivity between nodes that are known to a Map Resolver.  The
   emulated broadcast domain is configured to the system, e.g., with a
   VXLAN network identifier (VNID).  Broadcast operations on the overlay
   can be emulated but can become very expensive, and it makes sense to
   proactively install the relevant state in the mapping server as
   opposed to rely on reactive broadcast lookups to do so.

   An IEEE Std. 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11] Infrastructure Basic Service
   Set (BSS) also provides a transitive closure of nodes as defined by
   the broadcast domain of a central AP.  The AP relays both unicast and
   broadcast packets and provides the symmetric and transitive emulation
   of a shared wire between the associated nodes, with the capability to
   signal link-up/link-down to the upper layer.  Within a BSS, the



Thubert & Richardson      Expires 21 March 2024                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   physical broadcast domain of the AP serves as emulated broadcast
   domain for all the nodes that are associated to the AP.  Broadcast
   packets are relayed by the AP and are not acknowledged.  To increase
   the chances that all nodes in the BSS receive the broadcast
   transmission, AP transmits at the slowest PHY speed.  This translates
   into maximum co-channel interferences for others and the longest
   occupancy of the medium, for a duration that can be a hundred times
   that of the unicast transmission of a frame of the same size.

   For that reason, upper-layer protocols (ULPs) should tend to avoid
   the use of broadcast when operating over IEEE std 802.11 [IEEE Std.
   802.11] as they already typically do over IEEE std 802.15.4 [IEEE
   Std. 802.15.4].  To cope with these problems, APs may implement
   strategies such as turn a broadcast into a series of unicast
   transmissions, or drop the message altogether, which may impact the
   upper-layer protocols.  For instance, some APs may not copy Router
   Solicitation (RS) messages under the assumption that there is no
   router across the wireless network.  This assumption may be correct
   at some point of time and may become incorrect in the future.
   Another strategy used in Wi-Fi APS is to proxy protocols that heavily
   rely on broadcast, such as the address Resolution in ARP and IPv6 ND,
   and either respond on behalf or preferably forward the broadcast
   frame as a unicast to the intended Target.

   In an IEEE Std. 802.11 [IEEE Std. 802.11] Infrastructure Extended
   Service Set (ESS), infrastructure BSSes are interconnected by a
   bridged network, typically running Transparent Bridging and the
   Spanning tree Protocol or a more advanced link-layer Routing (L2R)
   scheme.  In the original model of learning bridges, the forwarding
   state is set by observing the source MAC address of the frames.  When
   a state is missing for a destination MAC address, the frame is
   broadcasted with the expectation that the response will populate the
   state on the reverse path.  This is a reactive operation, meaning
   that the state is populated reactively to the need to reach a
   destination.  It is also possible in the original model to broadcast
   a gratuitous frame to advertise self throughout the bridged network,
   and that is also a broadcast.

   The process of the Wi-Fi association prepares a bridging state
   proactively at the AP, which avoids the need for a reactive broadcast
   lookup over the wireless access.  In an ESS, the AP may also generate
   a gratuitous broadcast sourced at the MAC address of the STA to
   prepare or update the state in the learning bridges so they point
   towards the AP for the MAC address of the STA.  This framework
   emulates that proactive method at the network layer for the
   operations of AR, DAD and ND proxy.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   In some instances of WLANs and LoWPANs, a Mesh-Under technology
   (e.g., a IEEE Std. 802.11s or IEEE Std. 802.15.10) provides meshing
   services that are similar to bridging, and the broadcast domain is
   well-defined by the membership of the mesh.  Mesh-Under emulates a
   broadcast domain by flooding the broadcast packets at the link layer.
   When operating on a single frequency, this operation is known to
   interfere with itself, and requires inter-frame gaps to dampen the
   collisions, which reduces further the amount of available bandwidth.

   As the cost of broadcast transmissions becomes increasingly
   expensive, there is a push to rethink the upper-layer protocols to
   reduce the dependency on broadcast operations.

4.3.3.  Mapping the IP Link Abstraction

   As introduced in Section 4.2.1, IPv6 defines a concept of IP Link,
   link scope and link-local Addresses (LLA), an LLA being unique and
   usable only within the scope of an IP Link.  The IPv6 ND [RFC4861]
   DAD [RFC4862] process uses a multicast transmission to detect a
   duplicate address, which requires that the owner of the address is
   connected to the link-layer broadcast domain of the sender.

   On a wired medium, the IP Link is often confused with the physical
   broadcast domain because both are determined by the serial cable or
   the Ethernet shared wire.  Ethernet Bridging reinforces that illusion
   with a link-layer broadcast domain that emulates a physical broadcast
   domain over the mesh of wires.  But the difference shows on legacy
   P2MP and NBMA networks such as ATM and Frame-Relay, on shared links,
   and on newer types of NBMA networks such as radio and composite
   radio-wires networks.  It also shows when private VLANs or link-layer
   cryptography restrict the capability to read a frame to a subset of
   the connected nodes.

   In Mesh-Under and Infrastructure BSS, the IP Link extends beyond the
   physical broadcast domain to the emulated link-layer broadcast
   domain.  Relying on multicast for the ND operation remains feasible
   but becomes highly detrimental to the unicast traffic, and becomes
   less and less energy-efficient and reliable as the network grows.

   On DMB radios, IP Links between peers come and go as the individual
   physical broadcast domains of the transmitters meet and overlap.  The
   DAD operation cannot provide once and for all guarantees over the
   broadcast domain defined by one radio transmitter if that transmitter
   keeps meeting new peers on the go.

   The scope on which the uniqueness of an LLA must be checked is each
   new pair of nodes for the duration of their conversation.  As long as
   there's no conflict, a node may use the same LLA with multiple peers



Thubert & Richardson      Expires 21 March 2024                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   but it has to perform DAD again with each new peer.  A node may need
   to form a new LLA to talk to a new peer, and multiple LLAs may be
   present in the same radio network to talk to different peers.  In
   this framework, each pair of nodes defines a P2P IP Link, and define
   the domain where an LLA must be unique.

   The DAD and AR procedures in IPv6 ND expect that a node in a Subnet
   is reachable within the broadcast domain of any other node in the
   Subnet when that other node attempts to form an address that would be
   a duplicate or attempts to resolve the MAC address of this node.
   This is why ND is applicable for P2P and transit links, but requires
   extensions for more complex topologies.

4.3.4.  Mapping the IPv6 Subnet Abstraction

   As introduced in Section 4.2.3, IPv6 also defines the concept of a IP
   Subnet for IPv6 unicast addresses with a global scope, Global and
   Unique Local Addresses (GUA and ULA).  All the addresses in the same
   Subnet share the same prefix, and by extension, a node belongs to an
   IP Subnet if it has an address that derives from the prefix of the
   Subnet.  That address must be topologically correct, meaning that it
   must be installed on a sub-Interface that connects to the Subnet, for
   use with routers that expose the Subnet in their RA messages (see
   [RFC5942]).

   Unless intently replicated in different locations for very specific
   purposes, a Subnet prefix is unique within a routing system; for
   ULAs, the routing system is typically a limited domain, whereas for
   GUAs, it is the whole Internet.

   For that reason, it is sufficient to validate that an address that is
   formed from a Subnet prefix is unique within the scope of that Subnet
   to guarantee that it is globally unique within the whole routing
   system.  Note that a Subnet may become partitioned due to the loss of
   a wired or wireless link, so even that operation is not necessarily
   obvious, more in [DAD APPROACHES].

   The IPv6 aggregation model relies on the property that a packet from
   the outside of a Subnet can be routed to any router that belongs to
   the Subnet, and that this router will be able to either resolve the
   destination link-layer address and deliver the packet, or, in the
   case of an MLSN, route the packet to the destination within the
   Subnet.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   If the Subnet is known as on-link, then any node may also resolve the
   destination link-layer address and deliver the packet, but if the
   Subnet is not on-link, then a host in the Subnet that does not have a
   Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) for the destination will also need to pass
   the packet to a router, more in [RFC5942].

   On Ethernet, an IP Subnet is often congruent with an IP Link because
   both are determined by the physical attachment to a shared wire or an
   IEEE Std. 802.1 bridged domain.  In that case, the connectivity over
   the IP Link is both symmetric and transitive, the Subnet can appear
   as on-link, and any node can resolve a destination MAC address of any
   other node directly using IPv6 ND.

   But an IP Link and an IP Subnet are not always congruent.  In the
   case of a Shared Link, individual subnets may each encompass only a
   subset of the nodes connected to the link.  Conversely, in Route-Over
   Multi-link subnets (MLSN) [RFC4903], routers federate the links
   between nodes that belong to the Subnet, the Subnet is not on-link
   and it extends beyond any of the federated links.

4.4.  Subnet Neighbor Discovery and Routing

   This Architecture defines a new operation for ND that is based on 2
   major paradigm changes, a proactive address registration by hosts to
   their attachment routers and routing to host routes (/128) within the
   Subnet.  This allows ND to avoid the expectations of transit links
   and Subnet-wide broadcast domains.

   The proactive address registration, called Stateful address
   Autoconfiguration (SFAAC) by opposition to SLAAC, is agnostic to the
   method used for address Assignment, e.g., Manual, Semantically Opaque
   Autoconfiguration [RFC7217], randomized [RFC8981], or DHCPv6
   [RFC8415].  It does not change the IPv6 addressing [RFC4291] or the
   current practices of assigning prefixes, with typically a SPL of 64,
   to a Subnet.  But the DAD operation is performed as a unicast
   exchange with the abstract egistrar service.

   This Architecture combines SFAAC with the not-onlink model on the IP
   Interfaces.  Hosts do not expect the IP Subnet to be reachable over
   the L2 broadcast domain and rely on their routers to forward the
   packets inside and outside the Subnet.  In turn, the router expose to
   each other all the IPv6 addresses that are either owned or registered
   to it as host routes over a Subnet Gateway Protocol, a routing
   protocol that is specialized in routing inside the Subnet and can be
   decoupled with the IGP, that is the routing protocol used between
   subnets.

5.  A Framework for Stateful address Autoconfiguration and Subnet
    Routing

5.1.  Implementing Stateful address Autoconfiguration

   SFAAC was initially standardized for IoT and wireless links as
   [RFC6775], [RFC8505], and [RFC8928].  A new option in NS/NA messages,
   the Extended address Registration Option (EARO) signals that the
   Target address is being registered and provides the registration
   parameters [RFC8505].  This method allows to prepare and maintain the
   host routes in the routers and avoids the reactive address Resolution
   in IPv6 ND and the associated link-layer broadcast transmissions.

   The EARO provides information to the router that is independent to
   the routing protocol and routing can take multiple forms, from an SGP
   to a collapsed Hub-and-Spoke model where only one router owns and
   advertises the prefix.  [RFC8505] is already referenced as the
   registration interface to "RIFT: Routing in Fat Trees"
   [I-D.ietf-rift-rift] and "RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power
   and Lossy Networks" [RFC6550] with [RFC9010].

   Subnet ND (SND) instantiates the Architecture presented in Section 4;
   it combines SFAAC with a Backbone Router (6BBR) ND proxy function
   (more in [RFC8929]) operating as a network-layer Access Point.
   Multiple 6BBRs placed along the wireless edge of a Backbone link
   handle IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and forward packets over the backbone
   on behalf of the registered nodes on the wireless edge.  This enables
   to span a Subnet over an MLSN that federates edge wireless links with
   a high-speed, typically Ethernet, backbone (as a network-layer ESS).
   The ND proxy maintains the reachability for Global Unicast and link-
   local Addresses within the federated MLSN, either as a routing proxy
   where it replies with its own MAC address or as a bridging proxy that
   typically forwards the multicast ND messages as unicast link-layer
   frames to their target.  The wireless nodes can form any address they
   want and move freely from a wireless edge link to another, without
   renumbering.  In that case, the registrar is distributed between the
   6BBR, each 6BBR maintaining only a state for the subset of the
   addresses that were registered to it and for which it is
   authoritative.  When the 6BBR is not currently authoritative for a
   new address being registered to it, it relies on IPv6 ND that is used
   reactively over the backbone to obtain an existing registration state
   in the disaggragated registrar that the 6BBRs form collectively.

   This framework allows other implementations of the abstract concept
   of the registrar.  For instance, [EVPN-SFAAC] allows to distribute
   the registrar in every router, and leverages EVPN as the method to
   synchronize the registrar state between routers.  In that case, BGP
   acts both as the SGP to announce the reachability of the addresses

   and as the synchronization protocol between the distributed
   registrar.  All the routers know proactively the mapping for all the
   addresses, and there is no need for a reactive lookup as is the case
   for SND.  As another example, a Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)
   Map-Resolver [RFC6830] could support the EDAR/EDAC exchange either
   directly or via a proxy, and serve as registrar.

   The framework allows for mixed environments with registrations and
   IPv6 ND, using [RFC8929] to perform ND proxy operations on behalf of
   registered address and respond to DAD and lookups from legacy nodes,
   and prevent registering nodes from autoconfiguring addresses that
   exist in legacy nodes by performing DAD on behalf of the registering
   nodes, more in Section 7.

5.2.  Links and Link-Local Addresses

   For link-local Addresses, DAD is typically performed between
   communicating pairs of nodes and an NCE can be populated with a
   single unicast exchange.  In the case of a bridging proxies, though,
   the link-local traffic is bridged over the backbone and the DAD must
   proxied there as well.

   For instance, in the case of Bluetooth(R) Low Energy (BLE)
   [RFC7668][IEEEstd802151], the uniqueness of link-local Addresses
   needs only to be verified between the pair of communicating nodes,
   the central router and the peripheral host.  In that example, 2
   peripheral hosts connected to the same central router can not have
   the same link-local address because the addresses would collision at
   the central router which could not talk to both over the same network
   port, unless it can separate the IP Links, e.g., based on the remote
   MAC address.  The DAD operation from SFAAC is appropriate for that
   use case, but the one from ND is not, because the peripheral hosts
   are not on the same broadcast domain.

   On the other hand, the uniqueness of GUAs and ULAs is validated at
   the Subnet Level, using a logical registrar that is global to the
   Subnet.

5.3.  Subnets and Global Addresses

   SFAAC extends IPv6 ND for Hub-and-Spoke (e.g., BLE) and Route-Over
   (e.g., RPL) Multi-link subnets (MLSNs).

   In the Hub-and-Spoke case, each Hub-Spoke pair is a distinct IP Link,
   and a Subnet can be mapped on a collection of links that are
   connected to the Hub. The Subnet prefix is associated to the Hub.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   Acting as a router, the Hub advertises the prefix as not-on-link to
   the spokes in RA messages Prefix Information Options (PIO).  Acting
   as hosts, the Spokes autoconfigure addresses from that prefix and
   register them to the Hub with a corresponding lifetime.

   Acting as a registrar, the Hub maintains a binding table of all the
   registered IP addresses and rejects duplicate registrations, thus
   ensuring a DAD protection for a registered address even if the
   registering node is sleeping.

   The Hub also maintains an NCE for the registered addresses and can
   deliver a packet to any of them during their respective lifetimes.
   It can be observed that this design builds a form of network-layer
   Infrastructure BSS.

   A Route-Over MLSN is considered as a collection of Hub-and-Spoke
   where the Hubs form a connected dominating set of the member nodes of
   the Subnet, and IPv6 routing takes place between the Hubs within the
   Subnet.  A single logical registrar is deployed to serve the whole
   mesh.

   The registration in [RFC8505] is abstract to the routing protocol and
   provides enough information to feed a routing protocol such as RPL as
   specified in [RFC9010].  In a degraded mode, all the Hubs are
   connected to a same high speed backbone such as an Ethernet bridging
   domain where IPv6 ND is operated.  In that case, it is possible to
   federate the Hub, Spoke and Backbone nodes as a single Subnet,
   operating ND proxy operations [RFC8929] at the Hubs, acting as 6BBRs.
   It can be observed that this latter design builds a form of network-
   layer Infrastructure ESS.

5.4.  Anycast and Multicast Addresses

   While IPv6 ND is defined for unicast addresses only,
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] extends [RFC8505] for anycast
   and multicast IPv6 addresses.  Though RPL [RFC6550], which is
   extended in that document, is the SGP of choice in a Low-power Lossy
   Network (LLN), the registration is agnostic to the SGP and the same
   model applies to any SGP that is capable of advertising multicast
   and/or anycast addresses as well as unicast.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration] can be used as a replacement
   for MLD [RFC3810] for use cases where broadcast are not desirable,
   and when a device push model such as SFAAC is preferred over a
   network pull such as MLD and IPv6 ND.  With [RFC8505], the host does
   not need to define SNMAs for its unicast addresses and does not
   perform the associated MLDv2 operation.  With
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-multicast-registration], MLDv2 and its extensive use of
   broadcast can be totally eliminated.

   In the case of anycast, the signal enables the 6BBRs to accept more
   than one registration for the same address, and collectively elect
   the registering host receives a packet for a given anycast address.

5.5.  P2MP Networks

   In the case of P2MP networks, there is not necessarily a direct IP
   Link between a source and a destination that are in the same subnet.
   The expectation is that routers running a common SGP form a connected
   dominating set for the IP Subnet, meaning that every router can reach
   every other router directly or via some other routers, and that every
   host that has addresses in the IP Subnet is connected to at least one
   router that participates to the SGP.

   The connected assumption allows any host to reach any other node in
   the subnet via one or more SGP routers, relying on the SGP alone for
   the forwarding decision inside the MLSN.  Outreaching gateways for
   the subnet also inject a default route and more specific routes to
   external destinations.

   In the resulting topology, IPv6 forms P2P IP Links between peer
   routers and hosts using [RFC8505].  A P2P IP Link is established
   between 2 nodes when one registers its link local address to the
   other.  The procedure for registering a link local address only
   requires that the link local address of each peer is unique from the
   perspective of the other peer, so it does not require any broadcast
   or third party validation.  The registration is typically triggered
   when receiving an RA messages that indicates a link local address for
   the router, and advertises that the router supports address
   registrations by [RFC8505].

   Global unicast, anycast and multicast addresses are advertised by
   hosts to routers using [RFC8505], and propagated router to router
   using the SGP under the control of the host.  A special "R" flag in
   the EARO indicates that the host expects the router to provide return
   reachability.  Upon that flag, the router advertises the registered
   address in the SGP, with a lifetime that is in the same order as that
   the router has accepted for the registration.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   Depending on its scope [RFC7346], a multicast message may reach up to
   different boundaries in the Subnet.  Admin-Local scope reaches all
   nodes in the Subnet and leverages the SGP.  Realm-Local scope reaches
   all the peers in a collection of IP Links, in which case ingress
   replication and MAC unicast transmission are used.  Link-Local scope
   reaches all nodes in the broadcast domain of an IP interface, in
   which case MAC-level broadcast may be used.  For instance, an RA
   message that is sent over the broadcast domain of an IP interface
   with a Link-Local scope and it will reach beyond the known IP Links
   over that interface.  This is required because the RA message can be
   the trigger for the creation of the IP Link.

   When a node roams outside the subnet, meaning that it is physically
   disconnected from all the routers is the IP Subnet, it may open a
   tunnel to one anchor router in the IP Subnet

5.6.  Advertising Prefixes

   By definition, prefixes longer than SPL are inside a Subnet and do
   not leak outside the SGP.  Still, it is valid for a node to register
   a prefix of any size longer than SPL, and for the router to advertise
   the registered prefix in the SGP.  This can be useful for instance to
   expose a /96 Prefix that is used to transport IPv4 mapped traffic
   [RFC6052].

   In a number of situation (e.g., [I-D.collink-v6ops-ent64pd] and
   [I-D.ietf-snac-simple] ) it becomes desirable for a node to advertise
   that it owns a prefix to neighbor routers, and that packets sourced
   at (in case of multihoming) or destinated to (in case of a stub) that
   prefix should be passed to this node.  At the time of this writing,
   the prefix is typically delegated by DHCP, and proprietary code ties
   the DHCP server that delegates a prefix, or a DHCP relay, and the
   routers that install a route for the delegated prefix via the
   delegated node.  it is desirable to provide a standard way for the
   delegated node to advertise the prefix to the neighbor routers and
   avoid proprietary extensions.

   [PREFIX REGISTRATION] extends [RFC8505] to enable a node that owns or
   is directly connected to a Prefix to register that Prefix to neighbor
   routers.  The registration indicates that the registered Prefix can
   be reached via the advertising node without a loop.  The prefix
   registration also provides a protocol-independent interface for the
   node to request the router to redistribute the prefix in the SGP.

6.  SND Applicability

   SND applies equally to physical links that are P2P, transit, P2MP
   Hub-and-Spoke, to links that provide link-layer Broadcast Domain
   Emulation such as Mesh-Under and Wi-Fi BSS, and to Route-Over meshes.
   In either cases, the IP Link abstraction in SND is always P2P.

   There is an intersection where The IP Link and the IP Subnet are
   congruent and where both ND and SND could apply.  These includes P2P,
   the MAC emulation of a PHY broadcast domain, and the particular case
   of always on, fully overlapping physical radio broadcast domain.  But
   even in those cases where both are possible, SND is preferable vs. ND
   because it reduces the need of broadcast; for more details, see the
   introduction of [RFC8929].

   There are also a number of practical use cases in the wireless world
   where links and subnets are not congruent:

   *  The IEEE Std. 802.11 infrastructure BSS enables one Subnet per AP,
      and emulates a broadcast domain at the link layer.  The
      Infrastructure ESS extends that model over a backbone and
      recommends the use of an ND proxy [IEEE Std. 802.11] to
      interoperate with Ethernet-connected nodes.  SND incorporates an
      ND proxy to serve that need, which was missing so far, , more in
      Section 6.2

   *  Bluetooth is Hub-and-Spoke at the link layer.  It would make
      little sense to configure a different Subnet between the central
      and each individual peripheral node (e.g., sensor).  Rather,
      [RFC7668] allocates a prefix to the central node acting as router,
      and each peripheral host (acting as a host) forms one or more
      address(es) from that same prefix and registers it, more in
      Section 6.4.3.

   *  A typical SmartGrid networks puts together Route-Over MLSNs that
      comprise thousands of IPv6 nodes.  The 6TiSCH architecture
      [RFC9030] presents the Route-Over model over an IEEE Std. 802.15.4
      Time-Slotted Channel-Hopping (TSCH) [IEEE Std. 802.15.4] mesh, and
      generalizes it for multiple other applications, more in
      Section 6.4.4.

      Each node in a SmartGrid network may have tens to a hundred others
      nodes in range.  A key problem for the routing protocol is which
      other node(s) should this node peer with, because most of the
      possible peers do not provide added routing value.  When both
      energy and bandwidth are constrained, talking to them is a waste
      of resources and most of the possible P2P links are not even used.
      Peerings that are actually used come and go with the dynamics of



Thubert & Richardson      Expires 21 March 2024                [Page 35]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


      radio signal propagation.  It results that allocating prefixes to
      all the possible P2P links and maintain as many addresses in all
      nodes is not even considered.

6.1.  Case of LPWANs

   LPWANs are by nature so constrained that the addresses and subnets
   are fully pre-configured and operate as P2P or Hub-and-Spoke.  This
   saves the steps of neighbor Discovery and enables a very efficient
   stateful compression of the IPv6 header.  So neither IPv6 ND nor SND
   is really used in that space.

6.2.  Case of Infrastructure IEEE std 802.11 BSS and ESS

   In contrast to IPv4, IPv6 enables a node to form multiple addresses,
   some of them temporary to elusive, and with a particular attention
   paid to privacy.  Addresses may be formed and deprecated
   asynchronously to the association.

   Snooping protocols such as IPv6 ND and DHCPv6 and observing data
   traffic sourced at the STA provides an imperfect knowledge of the
   state of the STA at the AP.  Missing a state or a transition may
   result in the loss of connectivity for some of the addresses, in
   particular for an address that is rarely used, belongs to a sleeping
   node, or one in a situation of mobility.  This may also result in
   undesirable remanent state in the AP when the STA ceases to use an
   IPv6 address while remaining associated.  It results that snooping
   protocols is not a recommended technique and that it should only be
   used as last resort, when the SND registration is not available to
   populate the state.

   The recommended alternative method is to use the SND Registration for
   IPv6 Addresses.  This way, the AP exposes its capability to proxy ND
   to the STA in Router Advertisement messages.  In turn, the STA may
   request proxy ND services from the AP for all of its IPv6 addresses,
   using the Extended address Registration Option, which provides the
   following elements:

   *  The registration state has a lifetime that limits unwanted state
      remanence in the network.

   *  The registration is optionally secured using [RFC8928] to prevent
      address theft and impersonation.

   *  The registration carries a sequence number, which enables to
      figure the order of events in a fast mobility scenario without
      loss of connectivity.

   The ESS mode requires a "ARP-Proxy" operation at the AP.  This
   includes a proxy ND operation that must cover Duplicate Address
   Detection, Neighbor Unreachability Detection, Address Resolution and
   Address Mobility to transfer a role of ND proxy to the AP where a STA
   is associated following the mobility of the STA.  New text in the
   802.11me revision (WIP) encourages to turn link-layer broadcast into
   unicast and let the STA respond for itself, as opposed to responding
   on behalf, unless operating as a sleep proxy.

   The SND proxy ND specification that associated to the address
   Registration is [RFC8929].  With that specification, the AP
   participates to the protocol as a Backbone Router, typically
   operating as a bridging proxy though the routing proxy operation is
   also possible.  As a bridging proxy, the backbone router either
   replies to NS lookups with the MAC address of the STA, or preferably
   forwards the lookups to the STA as link-layer unicast frames to let
   the STA answer.  For the data plane, the backbone router acts as a
   normal AP and bridges the packets to the STA as usual.  As a routing
   proxy, the backbone router replies with its own MAC address and then
   routes to the STA at the network layer.  The routing proxy reduces
   the need to expose the MAC address of the STA on the wired side, for
   a better stability and scalability of the bridged fabric.

6.3.  Case of Mesh Under Technologies

   The Mesh-Under provides a broadcast domain emulation with symmetric
   and Transitive properties and defines a transit link for IPv6
   operations.  It results that the model for IPv6 operation is similar
   to that of a BSS, with the root of the mesh operating as an Access
   Point does in a BSS/ESS.

   While it is still possible to operate IPv6 ND, the inefficiencies of
   the flooding operation make the associated operations even less
   desirable than in a BSS, and the use of SND is highly recommended.

6.4.  Case of DMB radios

   IPv6 over DMB radios uses P2P links that can be formed and maintained
   when a pair of DMB radios transmitters are in range from one another.

6.4.1.  Using IPv6 ND only

   DMB radios do not provide MAC level broadcast emulation.  An example
   of that is IEEE Std. 802.11 OCB which uses IEEE Std. 802.11 MAC/PHYs
   but does not provide the BSS functions.

   It is possible to form P2P IP Links between each individual pairs of
   nodes and operate IPv6 ND over those links with link-local addresses.
   DAD must be performed for all addresses on all P2P IP Links.

   If special deployment care is taken so that the physical broadcast
   domains of a collection of the nodes fully overlap, then it is also
   possible to build an IP Subnet within that collection of nodes and
   operate IPv6 ND.

   If an external mechanism avoids duplicate addresses and if the
   deployment ensures the connectivity between peers, a non-transit Hub-
   and-Spoke deployment is also possible where the Hub is the only
   router in the Subnet and the Prefix is advertised as not on-link.

6.4.2.  Using Subnet ND

   Though this can be achieved with IPv6 ND, SND is the recommended
   approach since it uses unicast communications which are more reliable
   and less impacting for other users of the medium.

   The routers send RAs with a SLLAO at a regular period.  The period
   can be indicated in the RA-Interval Option [RFC6275].  If available,
   the message can be transported in a compressed form in a beacon,
   e.g., in OCB Basic Safety Messages (BSM) that are nominally sent
   every 100ms.

   An active beaconing mode is possible whereby the Host sends broadcast
   RS messages to which a router can answer with a unicast RA.

   A router that has Internet connectivity and is willing to serve as an
   Internet Access may advertise itself as a default router [RFC4191] in
   its RA messages.  The RA is sent over an unspecified IP Link where it
   does not conflict to anyone, so DAD is not necessary at that stage.

   The host instantiates an IP Link where the router's address is not a
   duplicate.  To achieve this, it forms a link-local address that does
   not conflict with that of the router and registers to the router
   using [RFC8505].  If the router sent an RA(PIO), the host can also
   autoconfigure an address from the advertised prefix and register it.

   The lifetime in the registration should start with a small value
   (X=RMin, TBD), and exponentially grow with each re-registration to a
   larger value (X=Rmax, TBD).  The IP Link is considered down when
   (X=NbBeacons, TDB) expected messages are not received in a row.  It
   must be noted that the physical link flapping does not affect the
   state of the registration and when a physical link comes back up, the
   active registrations (i.e., registrations for which lifetime is not
   elapsed) are still usable.  Packets should be held or destroyed when
   the IP Link is down.

   P2P links may be federated in Hub-and-Spoke by edge routers, and the
   Subnet may comprise multiple edge routers, in which case each
   advertises its registered addresses over the SGP as illustrated in
   Figure 5.  Note that the Extended DAR/DAC exchange can be omitted if
   it can be replaced with the information that is distributed in the
   SGP, see for instance [RFC9010] which applies to IoT environments,
   which needs only the first EDAR/EDAC exchange, and [EVPN-SFAAC], for
   EVPN-based wireless deployments in enterprise and campus, which does
   not use EDAR/EDAC at all.

         Figure 5: RFC 8505 Registration Flow for a Global address

   An example Hub-and-Spoke is an OCB Road-Side Unit (RSU) that owns a
   prefix, provides Internet connectivity using that prefix to On-Board
   Units (OBUs) within its physical broadcast domain.  An example of
   Route-Over MLSN is a collection of cars in a parking lot operating
   RPL to extend the connectivity provided by the RSU beyond its
   physical broadcast domain.  Cars may then operate NEMO [RFC3963] for
   their own prefix using their address derived from the prefix of the
   RSU as CareOf address.

   As opposed to unicast addresses, there is no concept of duplication
   with multicast and anycast addresses, and there might be multiple
   registrations from multiple parties for the same address.  The router
   conserves one registration per party per multicast or anycast

   address, but injects the route into the SGP only once for each
   address, asynchronously to the registration.  On the other hand, the
   validation exchange with the registrar is still needed if the router
   checks the right for the host to listen to the anycast or multicast
   address.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


6.4.3.  Example: BLE and BLE Mesh

   "IPv6 over BLUETOOTH(R) Low Energy" [RFC7668] was defined after
   [RFC6775] but before [RFC8505].  In other words, IPv6 over BLE
   leverages SFAAC, but the specification needed to be upgraded to add
   the reference to [RFC8505] so it uses the upgraded method for the
   registration.

   This is updated by "IPv6 Mesh over BLUETOOTH(R) Low Energy Using the
   Internet Protocol Support Profile (IPSP)" [RFC9159].  [RFC9159] fully
   leverages SFAAC, referencing [RFC6775], [RFC8505], and [RFC8928].
   The IP Subnet and IP Link models defined in section 3.2 and 3.3 of
   [RFC9159], respectively, are in conformance with this Architecture.
   As for the SGP, [RFC9159] relies on the router role defined in the
   IPSP.

6.4.4.  Example: 6TiSCH

   The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping Mode (TSCH) of IEEE Std 802.15.4
   [IEEE Std. 802.15.4] defines one of the time-sensitive modes of IEEE
   Std 802.15.4.  TSCH is both a Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) and a
   Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) technique, whereby a different
   channel can be used for each transmission.  TSCH allows the
   scheduling of transmissions for deterministic operations and applies
   to the slower and most energy-constrained deterministic wireless use
   cases.  The scheduled operation provides for a more reliable
   experience, which can be used to monitor and manage resources, e.g.,
   energy and water, in a more efficient fashion.  Proven deterministic
   networking standards for use in process control, including ISA100.11a
   [ISA100.11a] and WirelessHART [WirelessHART], have demonstrated the
   capabilities of the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH MAC for high reliability
   against interference, low-power consumption on well-known flows, and
   its applicability for Traffic Engineering (TE) from a central
   controller.  As such, TSCH has become the de facto standard for IPv6
   in industrial wireless process control applications.

   "An Architecture for IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping Mode
   of IEEE 802.15.4"[RFC9030] defines how IPv6 is operated over TSCH.
   As is the case for BLE mesh, [RFC9030] conforms with this
   Architecture in its concepts of IP Link and IP Subnet, and references
   the SFAAC RFCs [RFC6775], [RFC8505], and [RFC8928] for the ND
   procedures.

   Additionally, the 6TiSCH Architecture leverages RPL [RFC6550] for the
   SGP, and allows to use ND Proxy operations [RFC8929] to federate
   multiple Links over a transit link called the backbone.  Some nodes
   may use SLAAC and see the prefix as on-link, mapping the backbone as
   a single IP transit Link, whereas other nodes rely on SFAAC and see



Thubert & Richardson      Expires 21 March 2024                [Page 43]

   the prefix as on-link, mapping multiple P2P IP Links over the
   backbone.  In that case, ND proxy operations handles AR from SLAAC
   nodes to SFAAC nodes, whereas the routers forward the traffic from
   SFAAC nodes to SLAAC nodes.  Note that MAC addresses being
   incompatible between IEEE Std 802.15.4 and IEEE Std 802.11, [RFC8929]
   operates in so called "routing proxy" between the 2, meaning that it
   impersonates the SLLAO of registered IPv6 addresses with its MAC
   address over the backbone, receives the traffic, and routes it over
   the edges links, using the appropriate MAC technology there.

7.  Coexistence with IPv6 ND

   The framework allows for a mixed environment with both models, IPv6
   ND and SFAAC, coexist.  With [RFC8929], an ethernet backbone link
   operating IPv6 ND federates a MultiLink Subnet (MLSN) of wireless
   links and/or meshes, and routers called Backbone Routers (6BBR)
   operate as ND proxies.

   In a wireless deployments, the Backbone Routers are placed along the
   wireless edge of a backbone (e.g., in Access Points) and federate
   multiple wireless links to form a single MLSN, echoing the Wi-Fi ESS
   structure but at the network layer, as shown in Figure 7.  In that
   example, Optimistic Duplicate address Detection (ODAD) [RFC4429]
   allows the IPv6 address to be used before completion of DAD, so the
   whole flow below can happen in the milliseconds that follow the Wi-Fi
   association.

     Figure 7: Initial Registration Flow to a 6BBR Acting as a ND Proxy

   In use cases such as overlays, a Map Resolver acting as 6LBR may be
   deployed on the Backbone Link to serve the whole Subnet, and EDAR/
   EDAC messages (or equivalent alternates, e.g., using LISP) can be
   used in combination with DAD to enable coexistence with IPv6 ND over
   the backbone.  The 6LBR proactive operations will then coexist on the
   Backbone with the reactive IPv6 ND operation.  Nodes that support

Internet-Draft               IPv6 over NBMA               September 2023


   [UNICAST AR] may query the mappings they look up with the 6LBR before
   attempting the reactive operation, which may be avoided if the 6LBR
   is conclusive, either detecting a duplication or returning a mapping.
   This model also enables a snooping switch acting as ND proxy to
   intercept Ar and DAD NS messages and perform unicast lookups to the
   resolver and only broadcast the original NS messgae when the unicast
   lookup fails.

   Note that the RS sent initially by the 6LN (e.g., a Wi-Fi STA) is
   transmitted as a multicast, but since it is intercepted by the 6BBR,
   it is never effectively broadcast at link layer.  The multiple arrows
   in Figure 7 associated to the ND messages on the backbone denote a
   real link-layer broadcast.

   It is not necessary to isolate the registering nodes in separate
   physical links, but it is preferred with wireless links as it enables
   to isolate the broadcast domain on the ethernet link from the
   wireless links at the Access Points.  In other words, the 6BBRs
   collectively form a global registrar for the Subnet that aggregates
   the information in each local registrar in the 6LBR.  The global
   registrar is distributed between the 6BBRs, which leverage IPv6 ND
   (AR and DAD) to lookup information that they do not have locally from
   the other 6BBRs and from nodes that are connected to the backbone.

   In the case of wireless meshes, RPL may be used as local SGP in each
   mesh as shown in Figure 8.  More details on the operation of SND and
   RPL over the MLSN can be found in section 3.1, 3.2, 4.1 and 4.2.2 of
   [RFC9030].

8.  Privacy Considerations

   IPv6 ND exposes all addresses to all nodes in the Subnet, which is a
   privacy issue and makes impersonation attacks easier.  In contrast,
   in switched and wireless networks, a host is not on-path of the
   unicast packets for registration and for data for other hosts, so it
   cannot snoop the other addresses in the network.  A rogue host can
   only discover the existence of an addresses by trying and failing to
   register that address, but for that it would need to fathom which
   address to try and that can be very hard in, say, a SPL=64 address
   space that is used wisely.  For that reason, this framework limits
   that knowledge to on-path snooping switches, to the routers and to
   the abstract registrar, which are typically more controlled / harder

   to hack than the common host.  When IPv6 ND and SFAAC coexist within
   the same Subnet, all addresses in the Subnet, including registered
   addresses, can be snooped in the broadcast domain where IPv6 ND is
   operated.  It makes sense to reduce that domain to the maximum and
   control which device connect to it.

   The exposure of addresses can be further reduced if the exchanges
   with the registrar (e.g., EDAR and EDAC) are encrypted, e.g., using a
   public key associated with the registrar.  The registration and
   routing exchanges could also be encrypted to avoid leaking the
   addresses to snopping switches, but this is typically not done inside
   a physical site where the networking gear is tightly controlled.  In
   a DCI environment, the inter-side (SD-WAN) links are typically
   encrypted, to the exchanges are obfuscated from an on-path listener.

9.  Security Considerations

   The registration model [RFC8505] implemented by this framework allows
   for a model where the ingress routers have a full knowledge of all
   the addresses in the Subnet.  The ingress router can thus discard any
   packet which destination appears to be in the Subnet from its prefix,
   but is not known, meaning that it does not exist.  This mostly
   defeats the traditional DoS scanning attacks against ND whereby the
   remote attacker sends volumes of packets to as many non-existent
   addresses to saturate the Neighbor Cache and clog the Subnet internal
   bandwidth in broadcasts.

   When the ownership verifier is cryptographic, this framework enables
   a zerotrust model whereby only the address owner can advertise an
   address in ND and as source of data packets, more in [RFC8928].  This
   defeats the classical impersonation attacks against IPv6 ND and
   allows to disable the proprietary middlebox software aimed at
   protecting the address ownership against onlink rogues.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require IANA action.
